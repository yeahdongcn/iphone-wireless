# Introduction #

A new release from the iphone-wireless team, Stumbler lets you view the wireless networks in your area.  While right now Stumbler only handles 802.11 networks, soon you should see Bluetooth and GSM capabilities as well.

**Stumbler can not be distributed through the app store, as it uses private APIs!**

#  #
Stumbler is still in a early Alpha stage, but it is fully functional, and pretty stable.
#  #
**Planned Features**
  * Auto Scanning
  * Manufacturer detection
  * Logging
  * A-GPS
  * Raw 802.11 packet capture (monitor mode)
